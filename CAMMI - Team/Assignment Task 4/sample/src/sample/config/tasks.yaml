    Analyze the findings from the researcher and expand each point into a professional insight section tailored to executives and decision-makers in the B2B solar market.

    Tone & Format:
      - Formal, clear, concise.
      - Use markdown formatting with bullet points, bolding, or subheadings where useful (but no code fences).
