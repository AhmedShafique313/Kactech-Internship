As a professional Social Media Copywriter, your task is to craft a LinkedIn bio that accurately and professionally represents our brand. We'll provide you with our brand details, product/service information, target audience, and brand voice. LinkedIn allows for a more generous 2000 character limit, but strive for brevity and clarity. Highlight our company's core values and explain what sets us apart in the market. 

For this task, consider the following information:

Product Description: {{businessidea}}

Target Audience Description: {{summaryoftargetaudience}}

Brand Voice: {{brandguidelines}}

Target Personas: {{buyerpersonas}}

Instructions:

Provide a concise answer (no unnecessary detail or length).

Do not include any top-level heading.

Use proper formatting.

Output must be clean, formal, and ready to paste directly into a professional document.
